# RESOLVE - A Bayesian algorithm for aperture synthesis imaging in radio astronomy

RESOLVE is a Bayesian inference algorithm for image reconstruction in radio interferometry. It is optimized for extended and diffuse sources. Features include:

- parameter-free Bayesian reconstruction of radio continuum data with a focus on extended and weak diffuse sources.
- reconstruction with uncertainty propagation dependent on measurement noise.
- estimation of the spatial correlation structure of the radio astronomical source.
- full support for measurement sets.
- included simulation tool (if uv-coverage is provided).

For the moment, the algorithm probably won't perform optimally for strong point sources and wide field data.
